## Introduction 
This miniproject is based on automated excelsheets where we can retrive and extract a particular data from a large group of files into a master sheet using python automation.
our main aim is to make data entry job easy and We are going to write a Python program that can process thousands of spreadsheets and manage all the calculations under a second for the user.

# 4W's and 1'H
## Who:
* Data entry operators 
*	Hotel management
*	Mentors and GEA academy can use the data for evaluation

**TBD**
## What:
 *	We are preparing the master excel sheet to search and retrive data
 *	for easy search of a particular cell or data of a person
 *	provides information of every person details like bio,academics,health 

**TBD**
## When:
*	Simple caluculations like average.
*	searching for person information
*	contact information
*	health check

**TBD**
## Where:
* To find data of a person in a organisation among a large group of people.
*	To manage information systematically and retrive data with in seconds.
*	Useful for automation of data entry in all the feilds.

**TBD**
## How:
*	Input:- User inputs related to the data in excel sheets
*	Output: -gives all the relevant information of particular input data given by the user
*	source: -excel sheets  gives the required output into the master sheet
