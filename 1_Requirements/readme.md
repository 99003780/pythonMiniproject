## Requirements:
To build python project to do searching for user input data and find that data among multiple excel sheet and combine them to form a new master sheet and display all the data.
 
 ## Objectives:
 In this python project we have to read multiple excel sheet data having 40 rows x 10 column that contain 3 similar column in each sheet i.e. PS number, Name & Email address. Next we have to take the user input for printing the desired student data in a master sheet. Here we are reading the multiple sheet and storing the similar student data into master sheet.

***Problem statement: Group-2 miniproject extension***
* master file should summarize / count the data across rows and publish the data in a new sheet
